# Time Complexity: O(log n)

# The algorithm uses binary search, which reduces the search space by half in each iteration.
# In the worst case, we need logâ‚‚(n) iterations to find the peak element.

# Space Complexity: O(1)

# The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size.
# Only three variables are used (l, r, and m) throughout the execution.

# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode: YES
